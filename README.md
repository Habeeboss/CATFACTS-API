This repository contains the solution for the HNG Internship (Stage 0 ‚Äì Backend) task for October 2025.  
The HNG-CATFACTS-API is a simple yet functional RESTful API built with Node.js and Express.js. Its primary purpose is to serve a user's profile information, a dynamic timestamp, and an engaging random cat fact. The cat fact is fetched dynamically from the external [Cat Facts API](https://catfact.ninja/).
This project demonstrates foundational backend development skills, including API creation, routing, external API integration, and handling dynamic data.
	
  User Profile Information: Returns predefined user details (email, name, stack).
	Dynamic Timestamp: Provides the current timestamp with each request.
	External API Integration: Fetches a random cat fact from `https://catfact.ninja/`.
	RESTful Design: Exposes a clear endpoint for data retrieval.
	
Endpoint	
GET '/me'
This endpoint returns a JSON object containing user details, a dynamic timestamp, and a random cat fact.
